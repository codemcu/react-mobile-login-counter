# Mobile Login Counter

It is a progressive web mobile app that allows us to log in with different users and shows us a counter with the time that has passed since the user's last access to the web

## `npm start`

The app runs in the development mode with `json-server`, which acts as the backend and with `npm-run-all`, which makes both run in parallel

the `json-server` has set `--delay 1500` to simulate a real call to the backend and show the spinner

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser<br /> and http://localhost:3001/users to see json users list

## `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## `npm run test:coverage`

Test run with React Testing Library
